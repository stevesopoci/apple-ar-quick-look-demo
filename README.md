[AR Quick Look](https://developer.apple.com/augmented-reality/quick-look/) also supports models and scenes created in [Reality Composer](https://developer.apple.com/augmented-reality/tools/), so you can easily create interactive experiences to be shared and viewed on iPhone and iPad.

Built-in apps, such as Safari, Messages, Mail, News, and Notes, use [AR Quick Look](https://developer.apple.com/augmented-reality/quick-look/) to display **USDZ** files of virtual objects in 3D or AR on iPhone and iPad. You can embed [AR Quick Look](https://developer.apple.com/augmented-reality/quick-look/) views in your apps and websites to let users see incredibly detailed object renderings in a real-world surrounding with support for animations and audio playback.
